# Introduction
The aim of this project is to extend the simulation framework established in the group Prof. Mark Robinson in collaboration with Pierre Luc Germain. More precisely the ``muscat`` simulation framework currently used in the group does not take gene-gene correlation into account. It is well known that gene-gene correlation is observed in real world data sets and we want to extend the framework such that the simulation framework respects this correlation.
